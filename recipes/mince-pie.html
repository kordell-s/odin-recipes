    <img src="/images/mince_pie.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A mince pie is a sweet English pie filled with mincemeat, which is a combination of dried fruits, warming spices, sugar, nuts,
        distilled spirits, and, traditionally, mutton or beef suet (though many modern recipes donâ€™t contain meat). 
        They are traditionally eaten during the Christmas season. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, divided</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>2/3 cup butter, softened</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons grated orange zest</li>
    <li>1/4 cup ince water</li>
    <li>3/4 cup prepared mincemeat pie filling</li>
    <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Sift flour, 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Use a pastry cutter or two forks to mix in butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs. </li>
     <li>Stir in orange zest. Sprinkle with ice water and gather dough into a ball. Roll out on a lightly floured surface to 1/4 inch thick. Cut out approximately 18 (3-inch) diameter circles, and 18 (2-inch) circles, re-rolling dough as needed..</li>
    <li>Line muffin cups or mini tart tins using the 3-inch pastry circles. Fill each pastry cup with about 1 tablespoon of mincemeat filling. Top with 2-inch pastry circles, pinching circles together to seal the edges. Brush the top of each pie with egg.</li>
    <li>Bake pies in preheated oven until tops are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool slightly on wire racks. Dust with remaining 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar just before serving.</li>
